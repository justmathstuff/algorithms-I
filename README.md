**This repository contains my implementations for the algorithms taught in the Coursera course *Algorithms, Part I* from Princeton University**

You may notice that everything here is written in **Rust** but the course is taught with **Java**, so I can't submit it. Why?

BECAUSE RUST IS THE BEST LANGUAGE EVER!!!

Jokes aside, I wanted to extend my knowledge of Rust.
